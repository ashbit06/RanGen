# RanGen
game i made :)

Features:
- simpler random generation
- uses pen (stamps) instead of clones for better optimization
- same player sprite as the last one because there were no bugs in that
- no crash screen because theres no clones for it to load simultaneously
- experimental features (see exp. features below)
- move your mouse to the upper corners to play with some settings and activate exp. features

[TurboWarp full version (you're already here)](https://github.com/ashbit06/RanGen)

## Controls (Keyboard):
WAD to move
R to restart level if you get stuck
F to generate a new level
P to open the Pause menu

## [TurboWarp only] Controls (Game Controller):
Left stick (left & right) to move
Y to restart a level
X to generate a new level
Right stick for a cursor (press for left-click)
D-Pad for keys 1-4
Home for 0
Bumpers and Triggers for selecting and rotating a block in the Level Editor
Screen Capture to place a block in the Level Editor

Tips:
- If it looks like the level is impossible, try jumping out of the frame to the left and wall jump to get above the map.

Experimental Features and Functionality:
- Level Edit/Save/Load: editing works, but doesn't save. you can load levels just fine. Saving a RanGen level works tho
- Player trail: works, but laggy


This is my second shared attempt at RanGen, or random generation. I call it that because it sounds cooler and is shorter. I got the idea of making one of these from [@surlo_gamez](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/surlo_gamez) wasteland platformer. I recovered the first version for y'all if you'd like to play it. Here's the link: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/552030316/

For an extended version of the game, go to https://github.com/ashbit06/RanGen and download the RanGen.zip file. There will be an HTML file that you can open to play the game. Some features include full gamepad support.
